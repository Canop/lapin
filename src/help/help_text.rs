# Lapin

You're a cute rabbit `L`

You want to reach a patch of grass `g`

But foxes `F` and wolves `W` try to eat you

And hunters `H` will fire on you
(or on anything when they're drunk)

Fortunately, you're not alone:
a pink knight `K` fights all your foes!

Now, you probably know enough to play
(hit *esc* to get back to the game)

----

Here's if you want to know more:

**Lapin** is a turn-by-turn strategy game
You don't have to play fast,
hitting keys frenetically doesn't help

You'll meet some sheep `S`. They're cool
But they take too much space on the grass
so they can be a problem

Your friend the pink knight `K` is very heavy
he can't walk on sand `s`

You may find carrots `c`
When you eat them you can replay
which might help you escape

There's wine `w`  too
Of course a rabbit can't drink wine
But hunters can and then they're drunk

You can create and edit levels, which
may be as fun as playing them
Run ` lapin --help ` to know more
